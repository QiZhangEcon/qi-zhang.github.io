excerpt: 'Abstract: While existing studies on the Pollution Haven Hypothesis (PHH) find limited empirical support at the national level, fewer have examined it at a more granular spatial scale. This paper revisits the PHH by investigating the effects of the Key Cities Air Pollution Control (KCAPC) policy, a regional air quality program in China.  Using a synthetic difference-in-differences (SDID) design to address non-random selection in treated cities, I analyze how the policy affects both $SO_2$ outcomes and industrial composition across cities. The findings support the PHH at the regional level: Treated cities shift the source of pollution toward less pollution-intensive sectors, while neighboring cities experience growth in output and capital in pollution-intensive sectors. Further evidence suggests that these patterns are partly explained by strategic production reallocation by local governments via state-owned enterprises (SOEs), as well as firm-level shifts toward cleaner product lines. These findings underscore the importance of spatial context in evaluating environmental regulation and highlight how well-intentioned policies can reshape regional industrial structure in unintended ways.'
